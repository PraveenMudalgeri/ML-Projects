# Diabetes Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics, applying core AI and ML skills to real-world medical data analysis.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete end-to-end workflow—from data preprocessing to evaluation.
- `diabetes.csv`: Dataset of patient health metrics and diabetes outcomes.

## 🚀 Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes data distribution and highlights feature relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Missing value handling, encoding, and normalization.
- **Model Training:** Implements several algorithms (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) for prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measures performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and other diagnostics.
- **Visualization:** Provides clear plots to support insights and model interpretation.

## 📊 Dataset

This project commonly uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database or similar public datasets. Key features usually include:

- Pregnancies  
- Glucose  
- Blood pressure  
- Skin thickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- Diabetes pedigree function  
- Age  
- Outcome (target: diabetic or not)
