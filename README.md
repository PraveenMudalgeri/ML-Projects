# ML Projects

Welcome to the **ML Projects** repository!

This repo contains a collection of machine learning projects ranging from basic to advanced, designed to help me (and others) learn, practice, and improve ML skills.

## Repository Structure

- Each project is organized into a separate folder.
- Every project folder includes:
  - Project code and notebooks
  - The dataset used
  - A brief description and instructions

## Goals

- Practice and implement various machine learning algorithms and techniques.
- Learn about data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- Build a strong foundation for real-world ML applications.

## How to Explore

1. Browse the list of project folders in the repo.
2. Read the `README.md` or description file inside each project for details.
3. Run the code and experiment with the datasets to learn hands-on.

## Projects (so far)

- Basic ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Intermediate tasks (Classification, Clustering, etc.)
- Advanced projects (Neural Networks, Deep Learning, etc.)
- More projects coming soon!

Feel free to explore, clone, or contribute if you're interested in ML. This repo will be updated regularly as I continue to learn and add new projects.

Happy coding and learning!
